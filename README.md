### Git Basics
I knew some basic information about Git, but these lessons helped me to structure my knowledge.

:star: Course **Version Control with Git** completed. I've got a better understanding of a version control system and learned new helpful commands:
  + git branch;
  + git checkout;
  + git add;
  + git log --oneline;
  + git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all;
  + git commit --amend;
  + git revert;
  + git reset --soft and so on.

And their commit styleguide is worth using :arrow_right: <https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/>

:star: **Main: Introduction Sequence, Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes** (learngitbranching.js.org) completed. I've become aware of such commands as:
  + git fetch;
  + git rebase;
  + git pull;
  + git push and others.

### Linux CLI, and HTTP

:star: **Linux Survival** (4 modules) - finished. I've learned new commands to work with directories and files:
  - mkdir;
  - ls;
  - mv;
  - cd;
  - rm, rmdir and other.

I will definitely use some of them in future.

:star: Articles **"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know"** (part 1, 2) - read.
I knew some basic things and articles gave me extended information about HTTP, its methods and status codes. Also, I've learned about identification, authentication and caching.

-----
### Git Collaboration
:star: Course **GitHub & Collaboration** completed. Now I know how to work with remote repositiories, fork them and keep track of team's work.

  + git remote add - to add a connection to a new remote repository;
  + git remote -v - to see the details about a connection to a remote;
  + git shortlog;
  + git log --grep - to specify commited information;
  + git rebase -i `<base>` - to squash (combine) commits;
  + git push -f - to force push the commits.

:fire: *You should not rebase if you have already pushed the commits you want to rebase. It's better to create a backup branch for rebasing!*

:star: **Main: Ramping Up, Moving Work Around, Remote: To Origin and Beyond** (learngitbranching.js.org) completed. The topics were quite challenging, but I managed to pass them and got new commands to use:
  - git push `<remote> <place>` - to send commits from a local repository to a remote repository (where the commits *will come from* and *where the commits will go*);
  - git push origin `<source>:<destination>`;
  - git fetch origin `<source>:<destination>`;
  - git push origin :`<destination>` - for deleting branches;
  - git fetch origin :`<destination>` - for creating branches;
  - and others.

:zap: Learning Git's commands, I structured my knowledge about version control system. Now it doesn't seem so confusing. I'm going to use these commands as much as possible. :zap:
