### Git Basics
I knew some basic information about Git, but these lessons helped me to structure my knowledge.

:star: Course **Version Control with Git** completed. I've got a better understanding of a version control system and learned new helpful commands:
  + git branch
  + git checkout
  + git add
  + git log --oneline
  + git commit --amend
  + git revert
  + git reset --soft and so on.

And their commit styleguide is worth using :arrow_right: <https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/>

:star: **Main: Introduction Sequence, Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes** (learngitbranching.js.org) completed. I've become aware of such commands as:
  + git fetch
  + git rebase
  + git pull
  + git push and others.

### Linux CLI, and HTTP

:star: **Linux Survival** (4 modules) - finished. I've learned new commands to work with directories and files:
  - mkdir
  - ls
  - mv
  - cd
  - rm, rmdir
  - and other.

I will definitely use some of them in future.

:star: Articles "HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know" (part 1, 2) - read.
I knew some basic things and articles gave me extended information about HTTP, its methods and status codes. Also, I've learned about identification, authentication and caching.
