### Git Basics
I knew some basic information about Git, but these lessons helped me to structure my knowledge.

:star: Course **Version Control with Git** completed. I've got a better understanding of a version control system and learned new helpful commands:
  + git branch;
  + git checkout;
  + git add;
  + git log --oneline;
  + git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all;
  + git commit --amend;
  + git revert;
  + git reset --soft and so on.

And their commit styleguide is worth using :arrow_right: <https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/>

:star: **Main: Introduction Sequence, Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes** (learngitbranching.js.org) completed. I've become aware of such commands as:
  + git fetch;
  + git rebase;
  + git pull;
  + git push and others.

### Linux CLI and Networking

:star: **Linux Survival** (4 modules) - finished. I've learned new commands to work with directories and files:
  - mkdir;
  - ls;
  - mv;
  - cd;
  - rm, rmdir and other.

I will definitely use some of them in future.

![Linux_Survival](/task_linux_cli/linux_sirvival.jpg)

:star: Articles **"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know"** (part 1, 2) - read.
I knew some basic things and articles gave me extended information about HTTP, its methods and status codes. Also, I've learned about identification, authentication and caching.

-----
### Git Collaboration
:star: Course **GitHub & Collaboration** completed. Now I know how to work with remote repositiories, fork them and keep track of team's work.

  + git remote add - to add a connection to a new remote repository;
  + git remote -v - to see the details about a connection to a remote;
  + git shortlog;
  + git log --grep - to specify commited information;
  + git rebase -i `<base>` - to squash (combine) commits;
  + git push -f - to force push the commits.

:fire: *You should not rebase if you have already pushed the commits you want to rebase. It's better to create a backup branch for rebasing!*

![Udacity](/task_git_collaboration/udacity_github_collaboration.jpg)

:star: **Main: Ramping Up, Moving Work Around, Remote: To Origin and Beyond** (learngitbranching.js.org) completed. The topics were quite challenging, but I managed to pass them and got new commands to use:
  - git push `<remote> <place>` - to send commits from a local repository to a remote repository (where the commits *will come from* and *where the commits will go*);
  - git push origin `<source>:<destination>`;
  - git fetch origin `<source>:<destination>`;
  - git push origin :`<destination>` - for deleting branches;
  - git fetch origin :`<destination>` - for creating branches;
  - and others.

![Remote](/task_git_collaboration/learngitbranching_remote_advanced.jpg)

:zap: Learning Git's commands, I structured my knowledge about version control system. Now it doesn't seem so confusing. I'm going to use these commands as much as possible. :zap:

### Intro to HTML and CSS

:star: Course **Intro to HTML & CSS (Eng)** finished. It suits complete beginners (there was nothing new for me). But it was good to refresh some basic points.

![Udacity](/task_html_css_intro/udacity_intro_html_css.jpg)

:star: Course **Learn HTML(Eng)** finished. It gave me solid understanding of how create different parts of the web page. It's good to use Semantic HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation like:
  - `<header>`;
  - `<nav>`;
  - `<main>`;
  - `<footer>` and other.

![HTML](/task_html_css_intro/codecademy_html.jpg)

:star: Course **Learn CSS(Eng)** finished. I learned how to style and position HTML elements on the web page. The new information that I discovered was about CSS flexbox and its properties such as:
  + justify-content;
  + flex-direction;
  + align-content;
  + align-items;
  + flex-wrap and so on.

Another powerful layout system is **CSS Grid** that can change both columns and rows. There must be a grid container (the one on which display: grid is applied) that is the direct parent of all the grid items and the children or grid items (i.e. *direct* descendants) of the grid container. The propetries that are used for styling grid container and grid items are:
  - grid-template-columns / grid-template-rows (width value can be either in pixels(px) or percentages(%));
  - grid-column-gap / grid-row-gap - to determine the size of the gap between each row and each column;
  - grid-row-start / grid-row-end - allow single grid items to take up multiple rows (also works for columns);
  - grid-row-gap / grid-column-gap - to set the size of the gap between an elementâ€™s grid rows or columns;
  - and others.

### Responsive Web Design <a name="responsive-web-design"></a>

:star: Course **Responsive Web Design Fundamentals** completed. I refreshed some knowledge about media queries and I learned about patterns for responsive design:
  + Column Drop;
  + Mostly Fluid;
  + Layout Shifter;
  + Off Canvas.

:zap: The new thing for me is that it's better to start designing from the smallest viewport and then go bigger.

:bell: The other important thing: for small screens is to make tap-targets' size at least 48x48px.

![Responsive](/task_responsive_web_design/Udacity-responsive-web-design.jpg)

:star: **Flexbox Froggy** completed. It's quite interesting way to practice different properties of Flexbox such as:
  + justify-content - to align elements horizontally;
  + align-items - to align items vertically;
  + flex-direction - to set the direction in which the elements will be positioned in the container;
  + order - to change the places of the elements (it can have positive and negative values).

### HTML & CSS Practice

:star: Hooli-style Popup finished. I found out how to create popup menu without JavaScript and learned how to use css properties like:
  + position: relative;
  + position: absolute;
  + z-index;
  + overflow;
  + :focus state.

:arrow_down: Below you can find published web page and the code.

### JS Basics

:star2: Course **Intro to JS** completed. It has tons of new information. This course helped me to broad my basic knowledge. And below there are some things not to forget: :arrow_down:

*The scope* is defined as a specific portion of the code. There are three types of scope in Javascript:

*Global scope* - When a particular variable is visible anywhere in the code. Such a variable is generally called as Global variable.

*Function scope* - When a particular variable is visible within a particular function only. Such a variable is generally called as Local variable.

*Block scope* - When a particular variable is visible within a pair of { . . . } only.

There are three ways *to declare a variable:*

`let` - It is a new way to declare a variable in any scope - Global, Local, or Block. The value of this variable can be changed or reassigned anytime within its scope.

`const` - It is also a way to declare constants in any scope - Global, Local, or Block. Once you are assigned a value to a const variable, the value of this variable CANNOT be changed or reassigned throughout the code. 

`var` - This is the old way of declaring variables in only two scope - Global, or Local. Variables declared with the var keyword can not have Block Scope. The value of this variable can be changed or reassigned anytime within its scope. 

:fire: *It is common to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays).*

*Parameters vs. Arguments*: 
**A parameter** is always going to be a variable name and appears in the function declaration. On the other hand, **an argument** is always going to be a value (i.e. any of the JavaScript data types - a number, a string, a boolean, etc.) and will always appear in the code when the function is called or invoked.

*A function's return value can be stored in a variable or reused throughout your program as a function argument.*

*Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function.*

**Objects** are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript. They have properties (information about the object) and methods (functions or capabilities the object has).

![Udacity](/task_js_basics/Udacity-intro-to-js.jpg)

:star2: **freeCodeCamp excercises** completed. They are interesting and easy at the beginning and becomes more challenging closer to the end.

*Basic JavaScript* - really tiny exercises but have a lot of important information.

*ES6 Challenges* - I've practiced the most recent standardized version of JS - ECMAScript 6 or ES6.

*Basic Data Structures* - good excercises to learn how to manipulate arrays and objects.

*Basic Algorithm Scripting* - very interesting exercises to train your brain.

*Functional Programming* - I found out what it is about:

>Functional programming follows a few core principles:
>
>+ Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on >the arguments passed into them to make a calculation
>+ Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global >objects holding data
>+ Functions have minimal side effects in the program

:muscle: *Algorithm Scripting Challenges* - it was the hardest part and took a lot of efforts to finally complete it.
